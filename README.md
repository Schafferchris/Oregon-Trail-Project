# Oregon-Trail 

Welcome to the Oregon Trail! The year is 1350 and there is an alien invasion in your village. You
are headed out west to alert the king the invasion. Your goal is to travel by wagon 
(2000 miles). You start on March 1st, and your goal is to reach the kingdom by
December 31st. The trail is ardous, Each day costs you food and health. You can hunt and rest,
but you have to get there before winter! 

Furthermore, once reaching the destination you must persaude the king through conversations
to send in reinforcments. If he refuses you will be sentenced to death! Good Luck!!!


This program runs on Python, and will soon be using Tkinter.
